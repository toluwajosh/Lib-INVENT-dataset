    "This demo illustrates how to compute the distribution of the chemical properties and/or filter molecule data in SMILES format to only include drug-like molecules. The second tutorial provided in this repository demonstrates the process of slicing the filtered dataset according to reaction rules to prepare it for the training of the decorator model.\n",

    "### Motivation\n",
    "> **There are a number of reasons to pre-process the data used for training a generative model.**\n",
    "1. Removal of invalid or duplicated entries.\n",
    "2. Removal of unusual compounds that are clearly not drug-like (too big, reactive groups and etc.). There is normally no point training model on such examples since that bias will reflected by the generative model. \n",
    "3. Removal of rare tokens. There are rare compounds that can be seen as outliers. They in turn might contain rare tokens. Excluding them frees a slot in the vocabulary and makes it smaller. Smaller vocabulary means faster training and less memory. As a result removing compounds that introduce rare tokens to the vocabulary speeds up the generative model.\n",

    "`Lib-INVENT datasets` has an entry point that loads a specified `JSON` file on startup. `JSON` is a low-level data format that allows to specify a fairly large number of parameters in a cascading fashion very quickly. The parameters are structured into *blocks* which can in turn contain blocks or simple values, such as *True* or *False*, strings and numbers. In this tutorial, we will go through the different blocks step-by-step, explaining their purpose and potential values for given parameters. Note, that while we will write out the configuration as a `JSON` file in the end, in `python` we handle the same information as a simple `dict`."
